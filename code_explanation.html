<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- This line is the document type declaration (DOCTYPE) for HTML5. 
    It tells the browser that the document is written in HTML5, which is the latest version of HTML. -->


<html lang="en">
<!-- `<html lang="en">` is an important declaration in an HTML document. 
- `<html>` is the opening tag that marks the beginning of the HTML document.
- `lang` stands for "language," and in this context, it is used to specify the language of the
document's content. In this case, it's set to "en," which represents English.
- Setting the `lang` attribute to the appropriate language is essential for accessibility and
search engine optimization (SEO). It helps screen readers and search engines understand the language of the content,
making it more accessible to users with disabilities and ensuring that search engines index the content correctly.
- The `lang` attribute can also be used for localization. If your website has content in multiple
languages, you can set the `lang` attribute on specific sections or elements to indicate the language of that particular
content.
- While modern web browsers are quite good at automatically detecting the language of the
content, explicitly setting the `lang` attribute can help ensure consistent rendering and behavior across different
browsers and platforms.
- Search engines use the `lang` attribute as one of the factors in determining the relevance and
ranking of a webpage for specific language-based searches. So, setting it correctly can have SEO benefits.
